# 💻 Mini Project: Smart Travel Planner
📝 Project Definition

📌 Title: Smart Travel Planner

💡 Objective:
To create a JavaScript-based console application that helps users plan their travel by taking multiple inputs like destinations, budget, and number of travel days. The app will use arrays, loops, functions, ES6 features, and condition statements to provide useful travel suggestions.

🧩 Project Flow
🌍 Input Travel Destinations
Ask the user to enter 3–5 destinations (store in an array).
Use a for loop with prompt() for input.

💰 Budget Check

Ask the user to input their total budget.
If budget < ₹10,000 → "Plan a short domestic trip."
If budget ₹10,000–₹50,000 → "You can plan a long domestic trip."
If budget > ₹50,000 → "International trip possible!"

🗓️ Number of Days Calculator
Ask user for number of travel days.
If days < 3 → "Weekend Getaway."
If 3–7 days → "Perfect Holiday Trip."
If > 7 days → "Extended Vacation."

🛏️ Hotel Budget Suggestion (Function)
Use a function to suggest hotel type:
If budget/day < ₹2000 → "Budget Hotels."
If ₹2000–₹5000 → "Mid-range Hotels."
If > ₹5000 → "Luxury Hotels."

✅ Final Travel Summary
Use template literals (ES6) to print:
Destinations list
Total Budget
Days Planned
Hotel Suggestion
Trip Type

💡 Example Output:
Destinations Entered: [Manali, Goa, Jaipur]  
Total Budget: ₹35,000  
Days Planned: 5  
Trip Type: Perfect Holiday Trip  
Hotel Suggestion: Mid-range Hotels  
Travel Summary: You can enjoy a domestic holiday with comfort.  

📚 JavaScript Concepts Covered:
Arrays (storing destinations, looping through them)
Loops (for, for...of)
Functions (hotel suggestion logic)
ES6 Features (let, const, template literals, arrow functions)
Conditional Statements (trip type, budget, hotel suggestion)
User Input via prompt()

Output:
![]()
![]()
